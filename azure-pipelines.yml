# Important notes:
# 1. For this to work, you need to create a 'service connection' with the same name
#    as the 'publishFeedCredentials' value.
# 2. For security, you *must* ensure that 'Make secrets available to builds of forks'
#    is disabled in your PR validation settings (inside build -> Edit -> Triggers).
#    Otherwise, PRs would be able to push new packages even without being merged.
